This project is about learning visual words as deformable templates, using sparse coding principle.
It is achieved by sparse EM clustering on a large number of image patches collected from large images.
Sparse coding is used in the E step.

Run StartFromHere.m in Matlab, and monitor intermediate results in the folder ./output/ .
