This project is about learning visual words as deformable templates, using sparse coding principle.
It is achieved by sparse EM clustering on a large number of image patches collected from large images.
Sparse coding is used in the E step.

Run StartFromHere.m in Matlab, and monitor intermediate results in the folder ./output/ .

Then run GenerateHtml.m. This will generate a HTML page to document the experiment results. Please look
into the document/ folder.
